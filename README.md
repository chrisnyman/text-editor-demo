## The Short
I have created this mockup of a text editor to use in Campus. It makes use of [Draft WYSIWYG](https://jpuri.github.io/react-draft-wysiwyg/#/) which was built using [Draftjs](https://draftjs.org/) which was developed specifically for React.

## Play Around
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Therefore to run app navigate to the directory and type:

```
npm run start`
```

You can change the appearance of the text editor in `/src/styles/editor.css`.
